LiveVBR is an open-source online JND-aware two-pass per-title encoding bitrate ladder prediction tool.
The primary objective of LiveVBR is to extract the spatial and temporal complexity features for every video segment, and use that information to predict optimized bitrate-resolution-CRF triples for online per-title encoding.

LiveVBR is available open-source, published under the GPLv3 license.
